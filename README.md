# Monte Carlo simulations in Physics

Examples of Monte Carlo simulations in Physics using Metropolis algorithm:

- Ideal two state model
- Ising 2D model (interacting spins in absence of external magnetic field)

The two_state_snapshots python file performs a simulation at a given T
The two_state python file explores many simulations at different T and plots the evloution of Energy, Heat capacity, etc as a function of T

A general description of the Metropolis Algorithm can be found in LibreText [here](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mathematical_Physics_and_Pedagogy/Computational_Physics_(Chong)/13%3A_The_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Method/13.01%3A_Basic_Formulation)
