# Monte Carlo simulations in Physics

Examples of Monte Carlo simulations in Physics using Metropolis algorithm:

- Ideal two state model
- Ising 2D model (interacting spins in absence of external magnetic field)

The two_state_snapshots python file performs a simulation at a given T
The two_state python file explores many simulations at different T and plots the evloution of Energy, Heat capacity, etc as a function of T
