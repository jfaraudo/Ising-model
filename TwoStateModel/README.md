# Two State Model

Monte Carlo simulation of a two state model:
- Ground state (label s=-1) with energy 0
- Excited state (label s=+1) with energy E

The units are dimensionless, being $$k_BT/E$$ the reduced (dimensionless) temperature

The analytical solution of the model can be found elsewhere for example [here](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/355/Surveyhtml/node234.html)
